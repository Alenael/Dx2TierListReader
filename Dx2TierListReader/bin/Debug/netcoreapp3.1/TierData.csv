"Alice",TP,TP,8.5,9.5,8,"Very powerful in PVP as her instant-kill skill bypasses Endure-type skills and thus delete key threats.
Godly Panels, especially Panel 3, make her Top Tier.
High damage potential due to good stats and Dark Amp in Purple.
Can be used in most PVE content like Aura Gate, Brands of Sin (especially Vanity 11) and certain Kiwami.
Instant-kill ability trivializes many PVE Bosses (Bosses are immune but their adds are usually not except in Kiwami).","Needs Dark Pierce (weak) and Panel 3 to really shine, without those it puts her to around an 8 for PVP Offense and PVE.
Needs to run Divines without Panel 2 for first turn Die for Me!.
Skilled players will play around Alice defense, manipulating her to cast Mamudoon instead of Die for Me!. To mitigate this, have her MAtk as low as possible."
"Alilat",C,C,8,6,6,"While alive, Repel Pierce will prevent pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. Pair her with demons with a lot of Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or with Repel Phys (like Teal Gogmagog and Teal Quetzalcoatl).
Very high LUK stat allows her to be built as an Ailment caster by transfering an Ailment skill.
Thanks to stats and passives, she has extreme Ailment resistance: transfer her Silent Prayer or Prayer, she will be an Ailment cleanser.
A near Must-Have demon for PVE, particularly Aura Gate 2, as Repel Pierce paired with appropriate demons is perfect for cheesing most Boss fights.
Good HP and Vit stats and no weaknesses give her a lot of bulk.
Very cheap to fuse.","Megidola is a wasted skill as her Magic stat is low.
Lack of offensive demons with Repel Phys makes it hard to craft teams around her in PVP."
"Amaterasu",Y,CY,8,4,4,"One of the best PVE support demons in the game. Tenson Kourin is the best buff spell in the game, guaranteeing you will have all 3 buffs at the end of cast.
Gains access to discounted Mediarahan in Yellow, which heals for a lot thanks to her high magic stat.","High MP cost
Elec Weakness
Panels are very lackluster.
Maragion is a wasted slot for support builds.
Healing is less important in PvP, reducing her potential there."
"Ananta",R,P,4,7,7,"Purple provides all 3 Auto-Buffs, which is incredibly strong
Reasonable bulky with 3 Nulls makes him a decent support demon.
Works well in slow double Intimidating Stance Teams, and can be left at level 1 to lower battle speed if used as a pure buff bot.","Force weakness and no attack skills
Buffs disappear after a wave is cleared in PvE, so Auto-Skills arent as valuable there.
Relies heavily on transfer skills to function well. Unfortunately most good transfer skills are Gacha-only."
"Anat",P,CRP,8,8.5,8.5,"Thunderstorm is an extremely powerful piercing AOE.
High MAG stat, passive skills and Panels further her AOE DPS.
Killer Impulse may add another layer of damage.
Red gives Thunder Reign which can circumvent Elec Anti-Pierce such as Rama + Mother Harlot. Note that it does not pierce though!","Ice weakness
Without Panel 2, her PVP and PVE tier rating are lower than 8.
Expensive to fuse and only available in clear. Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.
Only Thunderstorm and Killer Impulse have pierce."
"Asherah",TP,TY,6,9,8.5,"Mother's Creation is the best Resurrection spell; Press Turn Generation is really strong.
Yellow has Silent Prayer which allows her to be used as an Ailment cleanser.
Her bulk can tank through the deadliest PVP teams and turn the tables with Mother's Creation.
Innate Mediarama and Recovery Amp in purple makes her a good healer for PVE.","High MP cost
Two weaknesses to common attacking elements.
Low AGI means she will need Lead Brands or even slower teammates to work as a Ailment cleanser.
Resurrection is not useful in PVE as your demons are not supposed to die. Healing is also subpar in PVE."
"Asura",TR,TP,8,5,5,"High STR and Ashura are devastating once/if the Boss is alone.
Three Faces Six Arms and his good innate bulk are the perfect counter to skills like Fire of Sinai and Griffon-Bolts.
Extremely strong for Phys Democalypse.
Mana Aid is fantastic for PVE farming as it lets him spam Ashura between waves.
Single-handedly trivializes Brands of Sin Deceit 11.","As nothing in his kit provides damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
Random Targetting makes him unusable in PvP. Using Ashura against Masakado means your death."
"Asura Lord",TRP,TRP,9,8.5,9,"Very high ST damage that also generates press turns thanks to his high Crit Rate.
Slaughter All is fully unblockable and ignores Endure-type skills, allowing you to delete key demons in PVP.
Endless War passively increases Crit Rate and Crit Damage of the team. Paired with Kartikeya, the total is +40% Crit Rate.
Very good synergy with Hero Masakado T1, an excellent Defense Team for PVP.
Gigantomachia in Red and his innate passives makes him an excellent PVE sweeper.
Good repel resistances makes him a natural partner for Alilat or Atavaka. Fire and Light repel perfectly counter Archangels teams.","Hard to raise Slaughter All's damage further as it is of the Almighty element.
High MP cost mandates the use of Divine Brands, if not P2, this reduces his damage output.
Risky to use for PVP Random Battle as he is suboptimal in Slow or Midrange teams and may put you in a difficult position in Fast teams whenever he fails to crit."
"Atavaka",TP,P,8,8,8,"While alive, War Aid will prevent pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. Pair him with multiple-Repels Demons (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or with Phys Repel (like Teal Gogmagog).
Intimidating Stance is a very powerful passive for PVP and synergizes with his low AGI.
Enemy Annihilation fully debuffs enemies before chaining into a piercing physical AOE sweep. Because the AOE is a chain effect, you will not lose press turns even if it misses and/or hits into Physical NDR, allowing him to spam it without concern.
Amazing set of panels that provide him extra damage.
Like Alilat, his Repel Pierce ability is perfect for cheesing Aura Gate 2 Boss fights.","Very high MP costs. And compensating with Divine Brands hurts his damage/Bulk.
Weak to Ice. A common element in PVP especially in very Offensive Teams.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his PVP AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.
The fact the debuff from Enemy Annihilation only lasts 1 turn with high MP-cost makes him unsuitable as a debuffer in PVE unless Panel 2."
"Baal",P,CRP,8,8,8,"Tempest deals high piercing AOE damage and autocasts Sukunda.
Rains of Canaan provides a teamwide Force damage boost.
Good synergy with other Force sweepers like Susano-o and Garuda A
Red gives Killing Wind which circumvent Force Anti-Pierce such as Rama + Susano-o A. Note that it does not pierce though!","Ice weakness
Without Panel 2, his PVP and PVE tier rating are lower than 8.
Expensive to fuse and only available in clear. Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.
Only has pierce through Tempest."
"Barong",TY,Any,6,4.5,4.5,"Barong Dance heals and buffs all stats.
With max lvl + Divine Brands, it can be cast on PVP Turn 1.
High AGI means, equipped with Speedster, he is suitable for PVP fast teams.
Niche use in Aura Gate as giving him Support AI and keeping his MAtk low enough guarantees he'll heal you with Barong Dance no matter your HP.
This is useful to recover HP lost from Talk and in F50 of Aura Gate 2 where you meet the Self Destruct Forneuses.","2 weaknesses.
Mediocre Magic and Bulk is bad as healer/support.
Barong Dance is limited to 3 uses making him a bad healer for PVE Bossing.
Panels are rather lackluster.
Outclassed by better PVE support like Asherah and Amaterasu."
"Bayonettaâ˜†",P,Any,5,6,6,"Madama Stomp levels and Savage Glee in purple give her enormous crit rates.
Madama Stomp autocasts an Almighty attack that also charms whenever she lands a crit. Deals decent damage after being buffed to scale off her PATK.
Recent buffs have made her a lot more viable. Panel 2 in particular gives her Pierce which she desperately needs.
Gomorrah (B) has high base damage and crit chance, letting you delete an enemy and charm the rest of the team.","Gomorrah (B) takes two turns to charge: impossible to use T1.
Difficult to build due to Gomorrah (B) scaling off both PATK and MATK.
Mediocre overall stats, bad bulk.
Absolutely requires at least P2 to have any relevancy in PVP: get a PVP rating much lower than 6 if not paneled.
No longer meme&#160;:("
"Black Frost",Any,Any,7,5,5,"High Magic stat and innate Pierce on Go to Hell! makes him a good magic sweeper.
Curse of Anguish and Panels pair well with Yama who automatically curses everyone at the start of the Boss wave.
Yellow gains access to Concentrate to further increase his sweeping potential.
His innate Mabufudyne and Ice Amp (in Purple) is excellent for Democalypse.","Light Weakness
Go to Hell! has low base power and does not gain damage on level up.
His damage output is below average and needs his Curse gimmick.
The Curse gimmick is impractical in PVP.
Dark element AOEs are severely countered by the PVP Meta (Masakado + Rama or Atavaka + Hecate)"
"Black Rider",T,P,5.5,6,6,"Soul Divide punishes healing by dealing Fractional damage based on their current health. Useful in Brands of Sin Vanity stages where healing is abundant.
Famine deals fractional damage and saps MP at the end of enemies turn.
Best used to deal with enemies that have auto-healing such as P2 Vishnu.
Decent Magic stat and good Panels can make him a strong Ice mage.","Soul Divide damage is based on Current Health and cannot kill targets.
Healing is not very common rendering his utility niche at best.
Needs Panels (especially P2) to be an effective Mage."
"Cu Chulainn",P,P,6,6,6,"Best budget pierce sweeper, he can be fused cheaply through 4x4 fusions.
One of the best demons to fuse early as he will trivialize a lot of early content.
No weaknesses reduce reliance on transfer skills.
Panels help him maintain relevance late game. It is cheap to Panel him.
While not common, he can be run as a physical nuker to some degree. He has innate Savage Glee and Gae Bolg hits hard against bosses (especially after Panels).
Low AGI makes him useable in Intimidating Stance teams.","High MP costs, cannot sweep Turn 1 in PVP unless P3.
Mediocre Magic stat: needs passives to be transferred for decent damage.
No ST attacks means he will have trouble against Anti-Force-Pierce in PVP.
Low AGI and LUK hinders his Phys potential."
"Cu Chulainn A",TR,TP,8.5,8.5,8.5,"Has full pierce on two elements.
Barbed Spear deals three separate hits, allowing it to function as an Endure breaker. He is a good candidate for Hero Masakado T1
Auto-Charge at end of turn allows him to deal massive damage if he is not taken out.
Teal has Drain Phys to pair with Rama in Drain Teams, increasing his survivability.","Needs to survive an entire round to make use of the Auto-Charge effect.
Missing just one of Barbed Spear's 12 hits will result in lost press turns.
Requires damage booster transfers as nothing in his kit provides it."
"Cybele",C,C,6,4.5,4.5,"High Magic stat. Magna Mater and innate Trisagion + Maragidyne make her an extremely good Fire caster.
Excellent Panel 1.
Magna Mater provides a team-wide Fire damage boost, incredible for Democalypse.
Innate Merciless Blow further increases her Democalypse potential.","Heavy fire specialisation + lack of Fire Pierce means she will struggle against Fire NDR.
In PVP, Fire Pierce (weak) is insufficient due to the popularity of Asherah and Rama
Expensive multi-fusion that requires clear Asherah."
"Daisoujou",Any,P,8,9,8,"Preach makes him immune to all ailments and will punish enemy teams attempting to use Charm. Cleansing Shout is an Ailment and Debuff Cleanse packed into one skill. This makes him the best Counter to Ailments.
Good stats, no weaknesses and perfect base kit allow freedom in builds.
Can work as a bulky tank, evasion tank, healer and/or revive support based on build.
Very useful for Brands of Sin Sloth 11 auto-runs.","Gacha Exclusive
Is a hard support unit, relies on transfer skills to offer anything outside cleanse."
"Danteâ˜†",Any,RP,5,5,5,"High Str plus Auto-Rebellion from Rapid Shot makes him a good Phys Sweeper.
Very bulky with no weaknesses.
Million Stab is a multihit AOE skill, breaking Endures and piercing while in Might.
Pairs well with Hell Biker for free Rebellion setup.
Meme","Low AGI and LUK affects his accuracy.
Will not autocast Rebellion if any of his Rapid Shot misses.
Mediocre Awakening skills."
"Fafnir",T,TP,4,5,5,"Innate Drain Phys makes him usable in Drain Teams.
High STR. Dragon Sense provides him additional accuracy and evasion.
Golden Greed increases poison damage ticks, dealing consistent damage each turn.","Ailments generally fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats.
Hard countered by Ailment Cleansers like Daisoujou or Kinmamon in PVP.
2 Weaknesses.
Blight has low base damage.
Is outclassed pretty much in every way by Pale Rider as a Poison caster."
"Frost Ace",P,RP,6,6,6,"Very good Ice Nuker with built-in Ice Boost and Master Assassin in purple.
Good Ice sweeper with Mabufula in red
Vengeful Frost Fist is a heavy hitting Ice-element Physical attack that can Crit and autocasts Rebellion on hit. This allows him to crit infinitely at the cost of a measly 4 MP.
Icy Rage provides a teamwide Ice damage buff, incredible for Democalypse.","No added accuracy in his kit. Requires Accuracy investment as Vengeful Frost Fist is prone to missing.
Vengeful Frost Fist cannot hit through Tetrakarn nor any Ice NDR without P3 or Ice Pierce (weak).
Non-fusable and not obtainable through the general gem banner or the summon files."
"Gabriel",TR,TR,8,8,8,"When combined with two other Herald or Divine demons, God's Word dishes out massive damage even before battle really begins.
Chain effects do not consume press turns even when hitting NDR.
Innate Pierce with decent Magic + Revive makes for a good unique Skill.
Part of a very strong PVP strategy: Archangels Team.
Good for PVE content like Brands of Sin Sloth, the general story and Aura Gate (note that her passive will kill demons before they have a chance to talk)","Needs a specific team built fully around her.
Reflected God's Word will damage her because of innate pierce. Beware of Alilat and Atavaka.
The Metagame is filled with teams tanky enough to survive Archangels teams."
"Garuda A",TYP,YRP,6,7,7,"Good Magic and Agi Stats
Innate Force pierce in Brilliant Wings and discount Mazandyne in Red.
Brilliant Wings fits well in an evasion based team together with Nekomata A.
Gale Talon is very damaging against lone targets like Bosses, making him very potent for Democalypse.","Needs a team built around him to be really effective
Useless against Magic teams
Gale Talon takes time to reach full potential, reducing his T1 potential."
"Garuda",Any,YRP,8,8,8,"One of the fastest and most flexible demons in the game. Good set of resistances plus battlespeed makes him useful for most PVE content including Aura Gate and Brands of Sin Vanity 11.
Auto-Rakunda: excellent offensive skill that synergizes with his Turn 1 focus.
Vahana, excellent defensive passive. Allows dodge-tank builds or even cleric ones if Prayer is transferred.
Red gives him access to 6-MP Maragidyne, giving him a Turn 1 nuke.
Yellow makes him more support-oriented with Fog Breath.
Purple gives him extra damage range for easier Turn 1 Damage.
Easy 4x4 fusion paths and good panels make him worth the fusion(s).","Does not have Speedster innately, requires a transfer which in turn reduces his skill slots.
Ice weakness
One of the lowest bulk in the game."
"Gogmagog",TR,CTR,7.5,7,6,"Very high bulk and innate Earthquake lets him hit hard off that bulk.
Three weaknesses makes him a good partner for Orcus.
Less competition for Brands compared to your other demons, as he relies on PDEF for damage.
Only transferrable source of Earthquake.
Panels let him play a more support-oriented role, providing team-wide bonuses as long as he is alive. Crit resistance is especially valuable in the current PVP meta, which has heavy crit emphasis.
Repel Phys in Teal pairs well with Alilat or Atavaka as an Anti-Pierce unit.","Abysmal AGI and LUK means he misses. A lot.
Added damage from Weakness can be too much for his passive heal.
Heal on weakness gimmick is heavily punished by Black Rider.
No innate pierce and is a bad choice for Hell Gongen due to his AGI.
As a sweeper, he is quite subpar. Prefer a support build."
"Guan Yu",TR,TP,8,9,9,"No weaknesses and high VIT stats make him very tanky, especially with Life Brands.
High STR and native Phys Pierce make him a physical powerhouse.
Loyal God of War refunds MP and heals him on a kill, giving him insane amounts of self-sustain.
Innate Savage Glee lets him Crit and generate Press Turns effectively, especially if given Epitome of Carnage or paired with Crit boosters like Asura Lord or Kartikeya.
Null Mortal in Purple, Drain Phys for pairing with Rama in Teal, Red for pure PvE.","Low Agi stat means he will have accuracy issues. Dragon Blade's chain effect will not activate if it misses on the first target.
Highly dependant on the first kill for tempo. Failing to secure the first kill will result in him not having enough MP for the next turn.
Only has ST skills unless in Red, which reduces his overall PvP usefulness"
"Hecate",TP,TP,8,8,8,"Hell's Trivia is a cheap, hard-hitting spell that also functions as an Endure breaker. Coupled with her respectable Mag stat and Dark Enhancement in purple, she can be built as a powerful dark mage.
Virtually immune to ailments thanks to Null Bind and Lunar Awakening.
Transferring Prayer or Silent Prayer makes her a cleanser with offensive ability.
Innate Repel Dark means she can't be sniped by Alice if paired with Alilat or Atavaka. This hard-counters people who use Ailment Teams for Random PVP Battles.
Amazing Panels: P2 lets her run Life or Spell Brands while not worrying about MP.","Not very bulky. Light weakness is dangerous in the Archangels matchup.
Lunar Awakening only triggers at the end of the enemy's turn. This makes her useless for Brands of Sin Sloth 11, as the ailments trigger at the beginning of the turn."
"Hresvelgr",RP,YRP,8,8,8,"Highest Base AGI and +20% to his Battle Speed on Panel 3: invaluable for fast teams.
His unique North Wind deals AOE Ice damage whenever an opposing demon dies. This adds to the damage of fast Turn 1 teams and allows him to clear Endures.
Auto-Rakunda in Purple further increases Turn 1 kill potential.
Decent MAG with innate Ice Boost lets him fire off strong Bufudynes.","No ice pierce.
No innate Speedster. You MUST transfer it to him.
2 weaknesses. Phys weakness is particularly bad."
"Huang Di",R,RP,8,6,6,"Superior Power gives him Phys Pierce and an accuracy boost.
Yinglong Killer hits incredibly hard and has a high crit rate, demolishing teams without anti-Pierce.
Extremely good PvE demon if you can Panel him.
No weaknesses","Needs to rely on transfer skills to increase his damage.
Lack of ST skills unless Red.
High MP costs.
AI is very unreliable for defense; will occasionally Yinglong Killer into Anti-Pierce and lose press turns.
No longer the absolute nightmare he was on release, needs Panels to keep up with newer demons."
"Huang Long",YP,YP,8,5,5,"High AGI means that combined with Speedster he can greatly boost your battle speed.
Combined with his decent MAG: makes him a suitable candidate for a fast mage pvp team.
Five Elements walls magical demons without Pierce, such as Mother Harlot, Masakado A and non-purple Rama.
Luster Candy in Yellow gives him even more support utility in buff control.
Trivializes Brands of Sin stage 10, opening up brand farming on Auto.","Pierce destroys him through Five Elements.
Five Elements can be removed through Makara Break especially P3 Samael.
Yellow AI has issues on auto as it will sometimes cast Luster Candy when you want to be spamming Five Elements instead.
Very MP hungry, needs Divine Brands or Mana Aid to function well.
Panels are lackluster."
"Indrajit",TP,P,6,9,8,"High Magic and good Agi Stats
High Burst Damage in Lightning Shower, which refunds MP on kill allowing him to loop it again.
Casts Five Elements on kill, which completely walls off Almighty attackers like Mother Harlot.
Maxed Lightning Shower lets him use Spell Brands and still cast it Turn 1 in PvP","Highly dependant on the first kill for tempo. Failing to kill will result in MP Problems.
Ice Weakness (Sort of mitigated by Five Elements on kill, but beware pierce users as well as being outsped)"
"Ishtar",TYR,TY,5,4,4,"Extremely high magic, combined with her Panels make her one of the strongest magic sweepers in the game.
Her unique spell Mesopotamian Star deals Almighty damage while autocasting Tarukaja and Tarunda. At Panel 3, this further applies Rakukaja and Sukukaja.
Gains Concentrate in Yellow, letting her nuke even harder.
Easy 4x4 fusion paths and good panels make her a decent P3 goal to strive toward.","Very high MP costs
Mesopotamian Star has low base power.
2 weaknesses
Low AGI stat and bad bulk."
"Ixtab",Any,YRP,5,8,6,"Yaxche autocast is almighty Mortal spell and ignores Endure-type skills.
You can leave her at Lv 1 to bait the AI into killing her and trigger Yaxche. Use teammates with Revive to repeat this cycle. Nidhoggr is perfect for this.
At Lv 1, she works well in Intimidating Stance Teams as she'd lower Battle Speed.
Yellow gives her a good Ailment skill to spam.
In Red, and Master Assassin and Zanma L transferred, she can hit lots of weaknesses in PVP and maybe 3-hit KO some tanks forcing the opponent into the dilemma of killing her.","Five Elements and Null Mortal blocks Yaxche, shutting her down.
Most important targets in PvE are immune to Mortal (Bosses, Kiwami Adds etc.)"
"Izanami",YRP,P,7,7,7,"Very high Magic stat. When paired with innate Merciless Blow, her unique Yomotsu Okami and Elec Amp in purple, she will decimate anything weak to Elec, making her perfect for Democalypse.
Yomotsu Okami provides a teamwide increase to Dark and Elec damage, further increasing her Democalypse potential.
Great set of panels that provide her MP reduction, Elec Pierce and increased damage.
Pairing her with Eileen can help to maximize Bolt Storm's potential.
Near mandatory for auto-farming Aura Gate 2 Floor 50.","Very expensive to fuse
Has no true ST or AOE spells.
Very RNG reliant in Democalypse as you cannot rely on Eileen to weather out bad Bolt Storm rolls."
"Jeanneâ˜†",P,P,4,4,4,"Madama Uppercut autocasts a follow-up Almighty attack upon Charm that also inflicts Bind.
Evade and Madama Uppercut levels increase her evasion and allow her to function as a dodge tank.
Gomorrah (J) has high base damage and crit chance, with a high chance to Bind all enemies.
Pairs well with Bayonetta or any other sources of charm like Lakshmi.","Gomorrah (J) takes two turns to charge, making T1 shenanigans impossible.
Awkward combination of balanced stats and having both Physical and Magic skills make her pretty mediocre at everything.
Very bad bulk means she will get shredded by Magic teams, which ignore her evasion.
Pretty much outclassed by P3 Lilith, who does Bind upon Charm better.
Panels do not benefit her much."
"Kartikeya",C,C,8.5,8.5,8,"Fastest demon in the game especially when passive is maxed, allowing you to hit battlespeed requirements in PVE easily.
Skanda proides teamwide Accuracy and Crit chance boost.
Mortal Jihad plus Great Aim means he will rarely miss, while having a good crit rate to generate press turns for your team.
No weaknesses and innate Speedster gives him great flexibility over transfer slots and lets him fulfill a variety of roles.
Important demon in the Hero Masakado T1 strategy, one of the strongest strategy.","No innate pierce means he will have trouble with Tetra Shift, unless you inherit Phys Pierce (weak).
Very expensive to fuse and panel."
"Lakshmi",Any,TP,5,5,5,"Extremely high Magic and Luck stats allow her to be built as either a Sweeper or an Ailment inflictor.

Countered very hard by Daisoujou clearing her charms and punishing her for using them.
2 weaknesses
Underwhelming without P3. She is below 6 in PVP without P3."
"Lucifer",P,P,5,6.5,6.5,"Morning Star is the most powerful Almighty AOE spell.
Add to it Purple and Panels to make it the most powerful AOE.
Good bulk especially with Panel 2 unlocked. This helps him live long enough to build up the MP necessary for Morning Star.
Makes him a strong Intimidating Stance Teams candidate.
Paired with Panel 1 Lucifuge, you can also use him in a devastating Turn 1 Sweeper team.
Repel Dark is sometimes useful with Alilat or Atavaka against bosses with Dark Pierce.","Light weakness
Very expensive to fuse and panel.
High MP costs means he loses all his value in long battles.
Panel 3 and excellent Brands are mandatory to avoid long battles.
Megidolaon and Trisagion aren't very useful.

"Lucifuge",C,C,6,6.5,6.5,"Hell's Ministry reduces Almighty cost for all Tyrant race demons and improves their bulk. Paired with his Panel 1 Bonus, this will give a whopping 2MP discount and enable powerful Turn 1 combos such as Lucifer's Morning Star.
Light Devourer is a hard-hitting single target Dark spell, further amplified by innate Dark Amp.
Clear gains access to discounted Necro Dogma. As it only costs 6MP when maxed (5MP if Panel 1), it can be fired off Turn 1 and giving your whole party a defensive buff as a bonus.","Extremely expensive to fuse: You are looking at nearly 10 million Magnetite from scratch.
Requires Panel 1 to really shine.
Unimpressive without good teammates. His best partner Lucifer is another very expensive fusion, and requires Panel 3 to be really competitive in PVP.
Middling AGI hurts battle speed for fast T1 teams.
Light weakness"
"Mahakala",RP,RP,8,8,7,"High Magic stats and innate Concentrate + Pierce from The Great Darkness make him a very powerful ST Nuker.
Wrathful Flame reduces defense, allowing your teammates to hit harder. It can also be cast on turn 1 PVP with spell brands if maxed.
Very effective in Democalypse boss rounds as buffs/debuffs are difficult to come by.
Goes through Endure as Wrathful Flame counts as three separate hits.","Lack of MP recovery means he cannot effectively spam Wrathful Flame in PVP.
Combination of ST and AOE in his kit, coupled with innate Fire Amp makes it difficult to further boost damage.
If Mahakala is not alive at the beginning of the turn The Great Darkness won't increase the turn count until Mahakala is revived and survives until the start of the following turn."
"Mara",P,P,8.5,4,4,"Only fuseable with innate Phys Pierce (in Purple).
High STR and LUK.

High MP-cost skills.
Expensive to fuse, and needs to be Panel 3 to become good in Late PvE.

Powerful and loaded passive in Warlord's Wrath.
A really strong ST Phys skill which can also inflict Mortal in Occult Flash.
Has no weakness and a perfect base kit, allowing you to tailor his remaining transfer slots however you like.
Teal paired with Rama allows him to act as an Anti-Pierce unit.","Low agility and high MP cost skills reduces his PVE viability, especially for battles over waves. This requires him to inherit certain skills or be paired with certain teammates to be fully effective in PVE.
Doesn't have the best Vitality stat.
Unable to be paired with Masakado A."
"Mastema",P,P,7,7,7,"Good Magic coupled with Trial of Hate's high base power makes him an incredible Light sweeper. The debuff is just icing on the cake.

Teal gives her Drain Phys, ideal for pairing with Rama. Notably, she is the only Drain Phys unit that can function as a magic sweeper.
Has access to discounted Debilitate in Yellow, letting her play a more support role if needed.
Works very well with slow Ailment teams. When paired with a P3 Samael or her own P1, Death Lust lets her charm without consuming press turns, and increases her damage dealt.","Force weakness
Full Almighty kit means she is shut down hard by Five Elements
Low AGI and high MP costs makes her unsuitable for fast teams.
Countered very hard by Daisoujou clearing her charms and punishing her for using them.
The MP drain aspect of Babylon Goblet is less useful for PVE, as the AI has infinite MP. It does allow you to replenish her MP indefinitely though."
"Nergal",RP,P,5,5,6,"Plague of Babylon removes Barriers and has a very high chance of landing Weak status, making him incredible setup for Ailment Teams.
High STR, Auto-Tarukaja and increased Accuracy from Meslamtaea make him a decent Physical demon, especially when Paneled.
Auto-Rebellion on Poison boosts his damage and synergizes with Pale Rider.
Is a very strong set up based sweeper.","Ailments fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats
Hard countered by Ailment Cleansers like Daisoujou or Kinmamon in PVP.
AGI too low for Ailment Teams standards.
P3 Samael offers similar barrier break without consuming a Press Turn. This is vital versus double Intimidating Stance Teams, as Nergal consuming a Press Turn means you are left with a single Press for casting a true ailment."
"Neroâ˜†",Any,RP,8,6,6,"Overture deals Piercing damage while giving him free Concentrate, letting him sweep hard.
Voltage synergises perfectly with Overture and gives your party attack and accuracy/evasions buffs.
Very good for Democalypse where he does not have to worry about MP issues and can repeatedly spam Concentrated Overtures while on Spell Brands for insane damage.","Hard countered by Anti-Pierce, as Overture will not autocast Concentrate (and by extension Voltage) if the attack hits into NDR.
Mediocre stats, relies on Concentrate from Overture to deal damage.
No ST skills if not in Red.
High MP costs and no MP recovery prevent him from spamming his spells freely.
Limited-time Collaboration unit, unlikely to return in the future.
As such, he has no Panels, meaning he is missing a lot of potential power."
"Orcus",TY,TY,6,8,8,"Very good bulk and survivability thanks to Hell's Gate providing AOE reduction.
Law of Hell and Hell's Gate pair well with demons with multiple weakness like Asherah and Hecatoncheires. Not only does it save them a transfer slot for covering weakness, it also provides the team additional AOE reduction.
Very good buff control with innate War Cry and Nocturne in Yellow.
Law of Hell eliminates his need to cover weaknesses. This allows him to further support the team through transfers like Samarecarm, Recarmdra, Auto-Tarunda etc.","You will still receive extra damage from open weaknesses.
Law of Hell only works on AOE damage. Single target skills will still hurt especially if they hit weakness.
Very MP Hungry, Divines help with the MP costs but in turn reduce his bulk.
Needs specific team compositions to work well."
"Pale Rider",TP,TY,5,8,8,"Very good in Ailment Team, as Pestilence will kill any enemy after 2 turns! This is very important as Ailment Teams struggle to build demons combining high damage, ailment rates and speed (they want to go first).
Good synergy with a set-up based sweeper Nergal. Nergal helps to remove any barriers and poison in turn triggers his own Meslamtaea passive.
Very effective as a random PVP defense to catch teams without ailment cleanse.
Gains the strongest debuff Debilitate in Yellow, letting him double as a debuffer.","Ailments generally fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats
Hard countered by Ailment Cleansers like Daisoujou or Kinmamon in PVP.
Pestilence only kicks in at the end of enemy's turn, giving them one whole turn to cleanse it away or just outright kill him.
Requires a specific team built around him to really work.
P1 and P2 don't contribute to the Ailment build.
Not obtainable through the general gem banner or the summon files."
"Quetzalcoatl",Any,TP,4,6,6,"Usually run as a support demon. Ce Acatls' Return is an incredible ressurection spell that brings all fallen party members back to life.
Repel Phys in Teal pairs well with Alilat or Atavaka as an Anti-Pierce unit.
Has 2 strong AOE spells, 3 if in Red.","High MP costs
Dark weakness
Low Magic stat wastes his AOE potential, despite having good spells and panels."
"Quetzalcoatl A",P,RP,7.5,9,8,"His passives, esp. in Purple, and Aztec Pulse make him a deadly Fire Sweeper.
Ce Acatl grants him a free revive once per battle, while refunding the press turn lost from his death. This makes him a great counter for Fast T1 Teams on offense, as anything short of a full team wipe will result in him coming back to life and reverse-sweeping with double Aztec Pulses.
Pairs well with Rama as he has Drain Fire. It counters Archangels (PVP) Team.
Red gives him access to discounted Trisagion, useful versus Fire Anti-Pierce.","Ce Acatl press turn generation only cancels out the lost press turn from his death.
Dark is a bad weakness to have: Alice and Hecate are very common in high PVP.
Purple has troubles versus Fire Anti-Pierce like Atavaka-Vairocana or Rama-Surt."
"Rama",Any,TYP,8,9,9,"While alive, Drain Pierce will prevent pierce skills from going through Drain resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high innate Drain (like Shiva) or against popular attack elements like Physical.
Drain Pierce makes him the center of Drain Teams, a Metagame PVP Team.
Brahmastra is a three-hit Almighty skill that functions as an Endure-breaker.
Yellow Rama can function as a good support demon with discounted Luster Candy.
Purple (Ice Pierce) lets him act as a sweeper with innate Mabufudyne. Concentrate transferred can further his sweeper build.
Teal (Drain Ice) is excellent to hard-cheese some PVE content.
Like Alilat, his Anti-Pierce passive is perfect for cheesing Boss fights.","High MP cost skills
Not very bulky"
"Raphael",TP,P,6,7,7,"Tailwind does massive damage against single targets, ideal for Bosses or cleaning up in PVP.
Innate Pierce with decent Magic + Revive makes for a good unique Skill.
Good for PVE content like Brands of Sin Sloth, the general story and Aura Gate.
One of the best demons to include in the Archangels strategy, a very strong strategy.","His chain attack does not deal damage, unlike Uriel and Gabriel.
Needs team built around him.
Non-fusable and not obtainable through the general gem banner or the summon files."
"Red Rider",TP,P,5.5,5,5,"Good Str, decent Agi and Luck means he will hit hard without much Accuracy issues.
Blade of Terror deals consistent Fractional damage based on enemies current HP, unaffected by buffs. Blade of Terror will bypass the accuracy check since it is a fractional skill.","Blade of Terror falls off later in the fight as it is based on Current HP.
Buffs and damage boosts only work on Bloodshed's Physical damage and not Blade of Terror's Fractional damage.
Blade of Terror doesn't do much damage as 25% is rather low for PVP and the max damage is capped against late game targets in PVE.
Not obtainable through the general gem banner or the summon files."
"Samael",P,P,5,7,7,"God's Malice is very good to lock down a single target with multiple Ailments.
Infinite Chakra helps to reduce MP requirements, allowing him to spam God's Malice.
P3 is insanely powerful, providing free Barrier Break and Makara Break at the start of turn without consuming Press Turns.
Great set of Panels that provide additional Ailment Infliction, reduce MP costs and the aforementioned breaks. Easy 4x4 fusion paths make him a good P3 goal to strive toward.
Mana Aid is a great transfer skill.","Elec weakness
Countered very hard by Daisoujou clearing his ailments and punishing him for using Charm.
Middling AGI hurts battle speed for fast Ailment teams."
"Seraph",C,C,5,2,2,"Very high Magic stat, combined with Garden of Eden and Merciless Blow lets him hit weaknesses hard.
Innate Trisagion and Thunderclap deal massive damage when targeting weakness.
Garden of Eden provides a teamwide boost to damage on hitting weakness, making him perfect for Democalypse.
Panels give him and his teammates even more damage.","Only obtainable through Democalypse grinding.
High MP costs make him unsuitable for anything outside Democalypse."
"Seth",CT,CT,6,4.5,4.5,"Ouas is a very powerful ST nuke that has a high crit rate and a strong heal.
Extremely high STR and LUK means he will hit hard and crit often.
Teal covers his weakness while Clear gives him an AOE skill in Titanomachia.
Yellow gives him Nocturne which allows him to play a more support-oriented role, especially with innate Debilitate.
Good set of panels that provide him damage, bulk and MP reduction.","Lacks Phys Pierce, reducing his viability in certain areas which require it.
Fire weakness
Zandyne is a wasted slot.
Requires damage boost transfers"
"Shiva A",TP,TP,9,9.5,9.5,"Third Eye is fully unblockable and will go through any elemental NDRs and barriers like Five Elements. It is also treated as a physical attack and as such can Crit (synergies well with Ishvara).
Ishvara provides auto-Rebellion and passively boosts his accuracy and crit chance.
Can be paired with Parvati for a devastating first-turn kill team in PVP.
Insane set of panels that give him everything he needs (accuracy, better ST and reduced MP cost).","Third Eye can miss.
Force weakness if not Teal."
"Shiva",TRP,TR,8,6,7,"High STR, AGI and LUK paired with innate Serial Killer and Vorpal Blade make him an effective Physical Sweeper.
Good candidate for the Hell Gongen team as it provides him much needed Phys Pierce.
Great set of Panels especially the insane Panel 3 MP-cost reduction.
Has three sets of Drain resistances and no weakness if in Teal, making him an ideal teammate for Rama.
At Panel 3, he's the best 4th Demon candidate for the Masakado A+Shiva A+P3 Zaou-Gongen devastating PVP Defense Team.","Pralaya is high-MP, low damage and blocked by Five Elements.
Without Panel 3, his PVP tier rating is lower than 6.
Do not possess innate Pierce: absolutely requires Zaou-Gongen's pierce set-up.
Very expensive to fuse."
"Siegfried",YRP,R,8,8,8,"Arms Mastery provides him free Phys Amp and +25% Accuracy when maxed.
Drain Phys and no weaknesses makes him an ideal demon to pair with Rama in Drain Teams.
Panels give him much needed Phys Pierce and reduces the damage from piercing Phys attacks.","Heavily reliant on panels; without P2, his Offense PVP rating is much lower than 8.
No AOE outside of Red.
Mediocre AGI and LUK stats."
"Surt",CP,C,5.5,7,7,"Great demon for slow teams, as he provides Intimidating Stance and Tetra Shift.
Ragnarok hits like a truck and has an MP refund when maxed.
Purple provides Fire Pierce if preferred for PVE.","Ice weakness
AI is very bad on Defense without Divine Brands, as he will only Ragnarok once and default to spamming Berserker God.
Low Magic stat
No innate Fire Pierce if Clear"
"Susano-o A",TRP,TP,8,8,9,"Is a Phys powerhouse with proper brands and can be used to focus down enemies quickly with Violent Slash.
Heavenly Valor punishes enemies who pass when used in PVP Defense teams.
Nulls Phys and Drains Force innately. Gains Drain Phys in Teal which goes well with Rama as Anti-Pierce.","No added Accuracy in his kit. Requires extra Accuracy investment from Brands or skill transfer to hit reliably.
Fire Weakness.
Only excels with great brands, since he needs offensive stats and bulk. Only decent with sub-par brands.
Heavenly Valor can be countered, and misses will trigger passives like Andalucia and Brilliant Wings."
"Susano-o",P,CP,6,6,6,"Very powerful Force nuker. Kusanagi hits extremely hard and autocasts Tarukaja to further buff your team's attack.
Easy 4x4 fusion paths and good panels make him a decent P3 goal to strive toward.
Since Kusanagi scales from Phys Attack, Mortal Jihad is also a viable method of attack.
His ability to effectively attack in two elements (Phys and Force) allows him to work around his lack of pierce in most situations.","Middling Accuracy means that Mortal Jihad will be prone to missing in higher tiers of PvP where evade builds are more common.
No innate pierce.
Fire Weakness"
"Thor",P,P,6,5,5,"Mjolnir deals massive damage against single targets, ideal for Bosses and Democalypse.
Has Elec Pierce in Purple.
Panel 1 and 3 give him a lot of damage.
High STR stat, innate Phys kit allow him a Phys build for PVE (in Red archetype).","AI is extremely bad on Auto, as Charge will mess him up.
Force Weakness.
Random targetting is very hard to use for PVP and and some PVE.
Needs AOE or ST Elec spells transferred.
Requires damage boost transfers and Panels to really shine.
His Phys build is subpar even compared to some 4-stars."
"Tokisada",RP,P,7.5,7,7,"Flag of Salvation boosts your entire team's light damage, making him useful for Brands of Sin: Sloth 11 and Light Democalypse. It also passively restores 1 MP to your whole party when clearing a wave.
Amakusa Uprising is quite a layered and strong Light Nuke, esp. with Panel 2.
Red gives is discounted Mahamadyne. Note that having this unlocked might mess up your Brands of Sin: Sloth 11 runs, as the AI will prioritize it over Amakusa Uprising.
Great set of Transferable skills and only source of Death Blow and Auto-Rebellion.","Requires Panel 2 to unlock his full potential for PVP, as being able to guarantee crits for extra turns is very powerful.
Without Panel 2 and/or Auto-Rebellion transfered, he would get a PVP rating around 6 or less.
Only has pierce through Amakusa Uprising, no Piercing AOE.
Needs accuracy investment for PVP, as Amakusa Uprising can miss."
"Trumpeter",Any,YRP,5,6.5,6.5,"Apocalypse deals strong Almighty AOE damage while having a high mute chance for a low MP cost.
Access to Concentrate to further increase his damage.
No weaknesses and 2 Nulls give him a lot of flexibility in skill transfers.","Mute from Apocalypse is blocked by Barrier, requires a teammate with Barrier Break or P2 to effectively work.
Apocalypse does not get higher damage from leveling up the skill or from Panels, and as an Almighty skill can only be boosted by passives such as Butcher, Serial Killer...
Hard countered by Five Elements.
Stiff competition from other Almighty sweepers like Mother Harlot."
"Uriel",TP,P,8,8,8,"When combined with two other Herald or Divine demons, God's Fire dishes out massive damage even before battle really begins. It also gives your party a Tarukaja attack buff.
Chain effects do not consume press turns even when hitting NDR.
Innate Pierce with decent Magic + Revive makes for a good unique Skill.
Part of a very strong PVP strategy: Archangels
Good for PVE content like Brands of Sin Sloth, the general story and Aura Gate (note that his passive will kill demons before they have a chance to talk)","Needs Team built around him.
Countered severely by P2 Asherah, a very common demon.
Non-fusable and not obtainable through the general gem banner or the summon files."
"Vairocana",TP,TP,6,7,7.5,"Good repel resistances makes him a natural partner for Alilat and Atavaka. Fire and Light repel is especially useful to counter Archangel teams, as it makes him immune to both their AOE elements.
High MAG, Butcher in purple and innate almighty AOE: he is a strong sweeper.
Radiant Mantra resets all buffs and debuffs at the start of enemy turn. When used in a slow team, this allows him to nullify auto-skills.
Path of Prominence and Radiant Mantra make him an excellent buff control demon.
No weaknesses and a self-sufficient kit gives him full flexibility over skill transfers.","Very hard to further boost almighty damage.
Wants to go second to fully abuse Radiant Mantra but his AGI is quite high.
Requires good teammates to shine.
Very high MP costs. Even with maxed Path of Prominence and Divine Brands, he won't be able to spam it consistently unless Panel 2 is also unlocked.
Almighty is shut down hard by Five Elements or Lord of Clouds."
"Vasuki",RP,CR,5,4,4,"Has Innate Insanity and Ice Boost for both Ailment infliction and damage.
Innate Butcher in Purple.
Halahala deals massive damage against single targets, ideal for Bosses and Democalypse.
P3 autocasts Rakunda, which is invaluable in Democalypse boss phases where buffs are hard to come by.
Decent AGI, suitable for a T1 mage team.","Ailments generally fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats
Poison (and by extension Insanity) does literally nothing for his Ice builds.
Lacks of pierce and being limited to only random targetting makes him very bad for PVP."
"Vishnu",CR,R,5,6,6,"High magic and good bulk make him a tanky Mage thanks to Avatar.
Gains discounted Megidolaon in Red.
Healing and MP reduction from Panels further his tanky Mage role.","Low AGI.
Fire weakness.
Low damage output compared to Top Tier demons.
Needs heavy investment from Brands and Panels to become really effective."
"Vâ˜†",Any,YR,5,8,8.5,"Griffon-Bolt is borderline oppressive when combined with Turn 1 teams with lots of Crit passing for Press Turn generation. Good teammates include Masakado A, Asura Lord and Kartikeya.
Will virtually never have MP issues thanks to Shadow-Shock giving him a free Almighty ST attack.
Balanced stats and no weaknesses give him flexibility in transfer skills.
Red and Yellow give him an Almighty AOE skills that debuffs.
Laughs at his enemies occasionally","Very harshly countered by Five Elements on Defense, as the AI does not know how to pass and will lose press turns attacking into it.
Relies on auto-attacks, does not contribute much if his teammates are spamming skills instead.
Demons with AOE reduction passives like Hecatoncheires and Orcus significantly reduces his damage.
Limited-time Collaboration unit, unlikely to return in the future."
"Yama",RP,P,7,5,8,"Very powerful Dark Mage. Guilty passively increases his dark damage while dealing bonus damage at the start of a boss wave.
Only true Dark Pierce demon in Purple.
Enma's Judgement provides team-wide Null Mortal and Rakukaja, which can be very powerful in PVP depending on tier.
Trivializes Brands of Sin Vanity 11, works well for Aura Gate.","Guilty only works on Boss wave, rendering it useless for PVP and most of PVE.
No AOE spell unless Red (which then loses Dark Pierce)."
"Yoshitsune",TP,TP,10,5,5,"Carries a native Mana Aid giving him 10 MP per wave to repeatedly Vorpal Blade or Hassou Tobi.
Innate Mana Aid, strong AoE and the best Multi-hit Phys Spell in the game, combined with Phys Amp in Purple makes him the best Phys Attacker for PvE, usable pretty much anywhere.
Fully upgraded Hassou Tobi sports a massive amount of phys damage on single targets.
Teal can be used to cheese certain PvE Content.","Only native pierce on Hassou Tobi.
Random Targetting on Hassou Tobi makes it bad against Waves and in PvP"
"Zaou-Gongen",R,R,9,6,8.5,"Kongo Zaou grants Phys Pierce to teammates under Rebellion.
Is one of the core demons of Hell Gongen, one of the best PVE Team Comps.
With Panel 3 he can start a crit loop, providing infinite Crits for the whole team and negating the need for Hell Biker.
Great set of Panels that provide additional damage, accuracy and team-wide Rebellion.
Absolute terror against people who PVP Random Battle if Panel 3 and put in a Hero Masakado T1 PVP Defense Team","To put into practice his 8.5 Defense PVP rating you need Masakado A and Shiva A, very rare demons.
Middling AGI lowers a lot Hell Gongen team Battle Speed, a team that needs to be as fast as possible in PVP.
Requires good Crit% Brands to run without Hell Biker at Panel 3, especially Lead Brand sets as you ideally want him to go first to provide free Rebellion for the whole team.
Without Panel 3, he is worth less than 6 in PVP ratings. Lack of Auto-Rebellion genome can also put a dent on his rating."
"Agni",YP,P,4.5,4,4,"Auto-Rakunda in Purple or Fog Breath in Yellow.
Excellent in all non-Phys Boss Democalypse due to Ignite Def auto-debuff.
Excellent Panel 3 (Fire Pierce (weak) on crack).
Apparently Ignite allows him an Ailment build (have him cast ailments while the auto-damage rains).","Would worth less than 4 in PVP rating without Panel 3.
Panel 3 is very hard to get as he is Banner exclusive.
Does not have a noticeable damage output kit even Paneled.
Not much better than more common 4-star for PVE.
Middling AGI: unfit for Fast or Intimidating Stance Teams"
"Anubis",P,P,4,3,3,"High MAG of 217 makes him a good budget mage even for elements other than dark.
A budget choice for any non-Phys Democalypse due to Merciless Blow in Purple","Low AGI + Low VIT isn't a good combination for survivability.
Doesn't benefit much from his high LUK stat
No innate AOE and is not the best single target damage dealer either."
"Anzu",RP,YR,4.5,3,3,"Decent AGI.
5MP double debuff in Yellow. (also innately has another double debuff)
Excellent demon for Elec Democalypse.","Ice weakness.
Low VIT.
Underwhelming."
"Attis",C,C,4,3.5,3.5,"Innate Enduring Soul and Recarmdra which are good support skills that synergyze well.
No weakness.
The result is he has 2 completely free transfer slot.
Okayish innate bulk in P3.","Doesn't have many other uses.
The skills you will transfer to him determine what other supporting role he'll have in addition to reviver."
"Azrael",CR,RP,3,2,2,"Has access to both Tetrakarn/Makarakarn in Clear, which can serves a niche in Early PvE when you don't have access to many mirrors.
Respectable MAG of 194.
Decent bulk for a mage and panels support it.","Has no innate skills to boost his good mag stat.
He loses his niche of double karns in late PvE and PvP due to the prevalence of Pierce.
Outclassed in Democalypse as Fire/Dark attacker"
"Beiji-Weng",TYR,YR,5,4,4,"Surprisingly fast with panels making an optimal choice in speed teams.
Good MAG stat and serves as an ice mage.
Is a good demon for Ice Democ in Red due to low amount of good ice users.
Can exploit the plentiful amount of demons with ice weakness.
One of the few Repel Ice demons (in Teal) as well as the cheapest one making him quite useful combined with Alilat against specific PvE content especially Bosses.","Struggles against bulkier demons like Hecatoncheires and HP sponges in PvE.
Glacial Blast is a redundant skill that serves him little.
No Pierce meaning walled against demons that N/D/R Ice and Judgement isn't a reliable choice against them even at 7 MP.
Vasuki is an upgraded Beiji-Weng in most aspects for PvP."
"Chernobog",YP,YP,5,4,4,"Ailment chain effect inflicting poison and bind if P3.
Perfect synergy with Nergal.","Somewhat low AGI: this is bad for Ailment Team
Strongly needs Nergal to have some viability in PVP.
...but Nergal himself isn't the best demon for Ailment Team.
Needs P3 to be viable in PVP. He would be lower than 4 in PVP if P3 were not taken into account."
"Dionysus",C,C,2,2,2,"Very high luck stat meaning he inflicts ailments often and doesn't take crits as often.
Panels that benefit from his luck such as crit resist/ailment infliction
Has some potential in stall teams","Has no attacking skill despite innate back attack
Only can be clear
Only can cause status from Euphoric Frenzy, which only activates when hit physically.
Meaning you have to transfer an ailment skill and else he is a dead weight with no skill to use in battle."
"Gucumatz",TY,TY,3,3,3,"Fairly bulky with his given stats/panels.
Low AGI stat but is low enough that it's actually good for slow teams.

Diminishing his support role.
Fire Weakness."
"Gurr",RP,RP,5,6,6,"Belongs to the class of demon you want at least one of in your team to go consistently first in PVE and PVP.
For PVE, he is not the best one from that class.
But he has innate Speedster.
Yaksha Claw a passive quick effect that can inflict Bind: ailment passive quick effects are extremely precious for Ailment Team.
This passive pairs perfectly with Pale Rider one of the strongest ailment demon of the game.","2 weaknesses
Phys weakness is extremely disavantageous.
Yaksha Claw is random target instead of AOE.
Yaksha Claw cannot bind if it gets Nulled, Repeled or Drained.

Call to Helheim is pretty decent passive in PvE as opportunities to debuff every wave aren't common.","Mamudo does little to benefit her and has no pierce.
Would worth less than 3.5 in PVP rating without Panel 3.
Call to Helheim isn't great for PvP due to the typically fast pace nature of it.
She has to kill for Call to Helheim to activate.
Frail and has middling speed."
"Jeanne d'Arc",TY,TY,6,4.5,2.5,"One of the best healer.
Orlean Prayer can be used to give 3 MP to a demon: in PVP, this can allow some demons to unleash spells they couldn't have T1.
Panel 3 gives Orlean Prayer some buff ability. This is very useful for the shenanegan mentioned above.
Has a good AGI. Perfect for this strategy.","Healing is not very powerful in this game.
Despite how good Orlean Prayer in P3 is, PVP is too fast and each turn press are too precious for such strategy to be good.
The AI won't perform such T1 strategy."
"Long",P,Y,5,2.5,2.5,"A good speed stat and mag for a 4*
Purple gives Mana Aid an excellent PvE skill.

Walled by demons that Null/Drain/Repel Physical without having Phys Pierce (weak)"
"Tlaltecuhtli",CP,CY,3,2,2,"Low enough AGI, that she functions well in slow teams.
