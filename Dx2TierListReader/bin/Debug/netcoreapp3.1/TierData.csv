"Alice",TP,TP,4,4,4,5,5,"Die for Me! inflicts Mortal (instant kill) and bypasses Endure-type skills, making her incredibly valuable in deleting key demons for PVP.
High MAG stat combined with Dark Amp in purple makes her a very powerful Dark Mage.
Incredible panels that give her damage amplification, MP cost reduction and increased uses of her signature unique skill.
She's cute!!","Needs Dark Pierce (weak) and Panel 3 to really shine.
Needs to run Divines without Panel 2 for first turn Die for Me! and to mitigate long term MP issues.
Weak to Light and by extension the Archangels matchup. Teal fixes this somewhat but you lose Dark Amp in return.","She has pretty bad AI (will sometimes Mamudoon instead of spamming DFM), keep this in mind when using her for Defense.
Mortal is lot less powerful against Xi Wangmu teams, as she will simply resurrect the Mortal-ed target and is immune to Mortal herself."
"Alice A",T,TP,5,5,5,1,2,"The only demon in the game with AOE Mortal. When paired with curse support like Nebiros, she can easily decimate entire teams without Null Curse and/or Null Mortal.
Drains 1 MP from the enemy at the start of their turn, which stops MANY T1 sweepers (eg Baal, Anat, Uriel) in their tracks.
Trivializes almost all PVE content like Aura Gate and Hell's Park - pair her with an AOE curse inflictor and instakill everyone!
Purple gains Null Mortal which prevents her from being killed by other Mortal users.
She's cute!!","Hard countered by Null Curse and Null Mortal.
Weak to Light and by extension the Archangels matchup. Teal fixes this somewhat but you lose Null Mortal in return.","Cannot be used in the same team with OG Alice."
"Alilat",C,C,4,3,3,1,1,"While alive, Repel Pierce will prevent pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high natural Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or against popular attack elements like Physical (example Teal Gogmagog).
Very high LUK stat allows her to be used as both an Ailment inflictor and a cleanser (especially with innate Infernal Mask and P1).
Good HP and Vit stats and no weaknesses give her a lot of bulk.
Very cheap to fuse.","Megidola is a wasted skill as her Magic stat is low.","One of only three demons that can negate pierce, and the only fuseable source. A near Must-Have demon for PVE, as Repel Pierce paired with appropriate demons is perfect for cheesing most Boss fights."
"Amaterasu",Y,C,4,2,2,3,3,"One of the best PVE support demons in the game. Tenson Kourin is the best buff spell in the game, guaranteeing you will have all 3 buffs at the end of cast.
Gains access to discounted Mediarahan in Yellow, which heals for a lot thanks to her high magic stat.","Maragion is a wasted slot for support builds.
High MP cost
Weak to Elec","Panels are very lackluster.
Healing is less important in PvP, reducing her potential there."
"Ananta",R,P,1,3,3,3,1,"Purple provides all 3 Auto-Buffs, which is incredibly strong
Reasonable bulky with 3 Nulls makes him a decent support demon. War Cry or Recarmdra can be transferred to increase his support potential.
Works well in slow double Intimidating Stance teams, and can be deliberately left at level 1 to lower battle speed if used as a pure buff bot.","Weak to Force
Buffs disappear after a wave is cleared in PvE, so Auto-Skills aren't as valuable there.
Relies heavily on transfer skills to function well. Unfortunately most good transfer skills are Gacha-only.","-"
"Anat",P,CP,4,5,5,5,3,"Thunderstorm deals high piercing AOE damage and autocasts Tarunda.
Killer Impulse lets her function as an Endure breaker, and has great synergy with Hresvelgr.","Weak to Force
Panel 2 is Mandatory for Turn 1 Thunderstorm.
Expensive to fuse and only available in clear. Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.
Only Thunderstorm and Killer Impulse have pierce.","Requires additional MP Support when going against Alice A teams
Red gives her discounted Thunder Reign which can be used against Elec Anti-Pierce such as Rama + Mother Harlot. Note that it does not pierce though!"
"Aniel",P,P,4,4,4,2,5,"Glorious Bolt restores 1 MP to the whole party (including himself) and costs a measly 5 MP to activate.
The MP restoration aspect is very powerful in the current PVP meta as a counter to Alice A's passive MP Drain. This is most notable on an Archangels comp, who previously had to run suboptimal techs like Lakshmi A to avoid being crippled by Give me Jewels.
Even outside Archangels, he can function as an offensive MP Battery to give T1 teams even more muscle.
Innate Thunderclap and Light Enhancement in Purple make him a powerful nuker for Light Democalypse.
Panel 3 unlocks a damage aura for your other Archangels, further elevating the damage ceiling of that team comp.
When used with Atavaka or Alilat, innate Repel Elec helps to soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.","As Archangels are mostly used as Glass Cannon teams, God's Grace is irrelevant most the time (outside of the passive damage boost).","-"
"Asherah",TP,TY,3,4,4,2,2,"Mother's Creation revives a unit with full HP while also generating Press Turn, allowing the resurrected unit to act immediately.
Silent Prayer in Yellow allows her act as a Pseudo-Cleric and also remove Barrier, Tetraja, Charge etc.
Innate Mediarama and Recovery Amp in Purple lets her function as a decent PVE healer.
Functions well in a Moirai Sisters team, as she can fulfill the Lady/Femme requirements while still providing massive utility.","Weak to Ice and Dark, both very common attacking elements.
Low AGI means she will need Lead Brands or even slower teammates to work as a Cleric.","Very powerful against Archangel Teams, as her sheer bulk and Fire damage reduction from Panel 2 ensures she can stay alive and turn the tables through Mother's Creation.
Beware revive sealing units like Skull Knight who can render Mother's Creation useless."
"Asura",R,T,4,2,2,4,5,"High STR and Ashura are devastating against lone targets like Bosses. This makes him a very strong Phys Democalypse unit.
Three Faces Six Arms and his good innate bulk are the perfect counter to skills like Fire of Sinai and Griffon-Bolts.
Mana Aid is fantastic for PVE farming as it lets him spam Ashura.
Single-handedly trivializes Brands of Sin Deceit 11.
Repel Phys in Teal and high VIT make him a good partner for Alilat and Atavaka.","Weak to Ice
As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.","His only Piercing attack being Random Target makes him near unusable in PvP. Using Ashura against Masakado means your death."
"Asura Lord",RP,TP,5,4,4,5,3,"Incredibly high ST damage that also generates press turns thanks to his high Crit Rate.
Passively increases your team's Crit Rate and Crit Damage through Endless War. Pairs very well with Kartikeya, as their combined passives will give your team a whopping +40% boost to Crit Rate.
Slaughter All is fully unblockable and ignores Endure-type skills, allowing you to delete any demon he claps. It is also very useful to clean up any remaining enemies (usually bosses) after your AOE demons have unleashed their payload, notably D11 Metatron.
Red gives him a powerful AOE in Gigantomachia. Combined with his innate Great Aim and pierce in Endless War, this makes him a terrifying sweeper.
Good repel resistances makes him a natural partner for Alilat or Atavaka. Fire and Light repel is especially useful to counter Archangel teams, as it makes him immune to both their AOE elements.","Hard to raise Slaughter All's damage further as it is of the Almighty element.
High MP cost mandates the use of Divine Brands if Panel 2 is not unlocked, which can slightly reduce his damage potential.
Middling AGI makes him slightly awkward to fit in fast or slow teams.","Fits well in Hero Masakado T1 Defense Teams, especially if Auto-Rebellion is transferred."
"Atavaka",TP,P,4,5,5,1,1,"While alive, War Aid will prevent pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high natural Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or against popular attack elements like Physical (example Teal Gogmagog).
Intimidating Stance is a very powerful passive for PVP and synergizes with his low AGI.
Enemy Annihilation fully debuffs enemies before chaining into a piercing physical AOE sweep. Because the AOE is a chain effect, you will not lose press turns even if it misses and/or hits into Physical NDR, allowing him to spam it without concern.","Weak to Ice.
Very high MP costs. Running Divine sets hurt his overall damage and/or Bulk.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.","One of only three demons that can negate pierce. He is also the only one with Intimidating Stance."
"Atropos",P,RP,2,5,5,3,3,"One of the core demons in the Moirai Sisters archetype. When combined with two other Lady or Femme demons (preferably her two other sisters), Passionate Rage dishes out massive damage before the battle really even begins.
Since Passionate Rage triggers at the start of the opponent turn, she can easily kill frail Turn 1 Sweepers especially if combined with the buff swing from Lachesis' Passionate Embrace.
Severed Fate deals Piercing Single Target damage and will automatically target Fire, Ice, Elec or Force weaknesses. Combined with innate Merciless Blow, she can heavily punish any demons who leave weakness open.
Purple gives her Infinite Chakra, allowing her to spam Severed Fate repeatedly even while on Spell Brands. Red gives her access to discounted Judgement, useful if you want an AOE to compliment her passive chains.
Her Panels provide valuable ailment immunity, making it harder for Ailment Teams to sweep her on revenge.","If the first Elec part of Passionate Rage is Anti-Pierced (for example Rama-Mother Harlot, Atavaka-Aniel), the second Fire part will not proc, literally halving her damage.
Requires a good team built around her.
Awkward mix of 4 Elements plus having both ST and AOE skills makes it difficult to boost her damage outside Elemental Cycle.
As Press Turns are calculated based on the number of demons alive at the start of the turn, any demons who survive Passionate Rage will gain access to multiple press turns. Several demons like Guts and Anat can abuse this to reverse sweep instead.
Due to the way the Moirai Sisters archetype is typically built, Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight are a very powerful counter.","Tzitzimitl bears special mention here. If she can survive Passionate Rage, she will gain immediate access to Disastrous Eclipse and Star of Darkness, letting her fire off hard-hitting AOE Revive Seals."
"Azazel",T,TP,2,3,3,4,3,"The only demon in the game with access to two innate Endures. He can stack up to 4 Endures as a result, giving him immense survivability as long as it is not bypassed.
Fallen Grigori provides him HP and MP sustain every turn (as long as he is below the 50% threshold). Combined with his Endure stacks, this can make him very difficult to kill.
Guillotine Blaze is a low MP single target Fire Nuke that pierces, ignores Endures and has high crit rate. This is further augmented by innate Fire Amp and constant Rebellion from Fallen Grigori.
Panel 2 fire off a free Guillotine Blaze every turn, letting him deal extra damage without consuming MP.","Weak to Elec, which is currently a very bad weakness to have thanks to Atropos.
Damage is lackluster in Fire Democalypse Boss Phase, as the Boss has +100% Crit Resist.
Only Guillotine Blaze has pierce.
Several skills like Sword of Actuation and Dragon Slayer completely ignore Endures, negating huge portion of his kit.","Red provides him discounted Maragidyne, giving him access to an AoE skill for PVE and/or Democalypse. Note that it will not pierce though!"
"Baal",P,RP,4,4,4,5,5,"Tempest deals high piercing AOE damage and autocasts Sukunda.
Rains of Canaan provides a teamwide Force damage boost.
Good synergy with other Force sweepers like Susano-o and Garuda A","Weak to Ice
Expensive to fuse and only available in clear. Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.
Only has pierce through Tempest.","Requires additional MP Support when going against Alice A teams.
Red gives him discounted Killing Wind which can be used against Force Anti-Pierce such as Rama + Susano-o A. Note that it does not pierce though!"
"Barong",T,Any,4,2,2,3,3,"Barong Dance provides a decent AOE heal while giving the party a full Luster Candy buff. It also has infinite uses and can be reduced to a mere 5 MP when maxed with Panel 1 unlocked.
Very high AGI allows him to be used as a fast support, especially with Speedster transferred for Battle Speed requirements.
Can be used as a buffer for Elec Democalypse thanks to Barong Dance having high cast priority.","Weak to Force and Dark.
Low MAG stat means he won't heal for much.
Elec attack spells (and Elec Amp in purple) are wasted slots considering his bad Magic stat.","Niche use in Aura Gate as giving him Support AI with his MAtk low enough guarantees he'll heal you with Barong Dance no matter your HP. This is useful to recover HP lost from Talk and/or enemy encounters."
"Bayonetta☆",P,Any,2,2,2,1,2,"Madama Stomp levels and Savage Glee in purple give her enormous crit rates.
Madama Stomp autocasts an Almighty attack that also charms whenever she lands a crit. Deals decent damage after being buffed to scale off her PATK.
Gomorrah (B) has high base damage and crit chance, letting you delete an enemy and charm the rest of the team.","Highly dependant on having Panel 2 unlocked for Phys Pierce.
Gomorrah (B) takes two turns to charge, and is difficult to build due to it scaling off both PATK and MATK.
Mediocre overall stats, bad bulk.","No longer meme :(
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if she will be rerun."
"Belial",P,P,3,3,3,5,2,"Flames of Gomorrah is a hard hitting fire phys skill that pierces, crits and can be cast T1 even with War brands. Fire Amp in Purple makes it even deadlier.
Sins of Sodom provides Fast-Debilitate if an enemy is cursed which pairs perfectly with the 80% curse-rate of Flames of Gomorrah, or Nebiros who can curse before your turn.
Panel 2 allows him to Crit indefinitely.","Weak to Ice
Lack of ST skills gives him trouble with Fire Anti-Pierce like Atavaka-Vairocana or Rama-Surt.","Many PvE enemies including certain Bosses are not immune to curse, making him an insane Debuffer for PvE."
"Black Frost",Any,Any,3,2,2,5,2,"High Magic stat and innate Pierce on Go to Hell! makes him a good magic sweeper.
Curse of Anguish and Panels pair well with Yama who automatically curses everyone at the start of the Boss wave.
Go to Hell! has a high Curse chance, which lets him setup for other curse-based sweepers like Alice A.
Yellow gains access to Concentrate to further increase his sweeping potential.
Innate Mabufudyne and Ice Amp in Purple lets him function as an excellent Ice Sweeper too, especially for Democalypse.","Weak to Light
Go to Hell! has low base power and does not gain damage on level up.
His damage output is below average and needs his Curse gimmick.
Dark element AOEs are severely countered by the PVP Meta (Masakado + Rama or Atavaka + Hecate)","-"
"Black Maria",T,TP,2,2,2,1,1,"Black Beckoning grows stronger with every passing turn, culminating in a massive Fractional damage nuke on turn 4.
Black Lullaby provides an AOE Heal while Muting all enemies. This further chains into a Rakukaja + Sukukaja buff with Panel 2 unlocked.
High LUK helps her with landing ailments and run a Dodge Tank build relatively well, especially if you have access to Panel 1 and/or Epitome of Madness.","Weak to Force
Black Beckoning has a low damage cap (3400 Max Damage combined). As a result, she will have trouble killing bulky units without additional damage support.
Black Beckoning boost level only increases if she is alive at the start of your turn. By repeatedly killing her, you can delay the Fractional nuke indefinitely.
Black Beckoning has a usage cap of 1 - once the max boost level nuke is fired, it will simply stop functioning for the rest of the battle.","Has decent synergy in a Moirai Sister team - she fulfills their skill requirements being of the Lady race, and the constant passive damage from Atropos brings targets down to Black Beckoning kill range. She will also benefit from any ailment immunity panels they have."
"Black Rider",T,P,2,3,3,4,2,"Soul Divide punishes healing by dealing Fractional damage based on their current health. Useful in Brands of Sin Vanity stages where healing is abundant.
Soul Divide also punishes passive healing such as Guan Yu's Loyal God of War and Hecate's Lunar Awakening.
Famine deals fractional damage to all enemies and saps 2 MP at the end of their turn. Pairs well with Alice A for a devastating MP denial comp.
Decent Magic stat and good Panels can make him a strong Ice mage.","Weak to Fire
Soul Divide damage is based on Current Health and cannot kill targets.
High AGI makes him awkward to slot in slow teams, despite the great synergy with Alice A.","-"
"Clotho",P,P,3,4,4,1,1,"A powerful (but not mandatory) addition to the Moirai Sisters archetype, Woven Fate is a 6 times use AOE Heal that also randomly revives one of your fallen teammates. Not only does this allow you to constantly revive Atropos, it also ensures all of their chain effects can go off.
When combined with two other Lady or Femme demons (preferably her two other sisters), Passionate Allure charms all enemies at the end of her turn. This forces teams to constantly waste turns curing Charm, while Passionate Rage constantly chips at them.
Has arguably the best Panels for ailment immunity. Panel 1 prevents the team from being swept by Alice A, while Panel 2 makes them immune to Charm in the events of a mirror match.
High LUK helps her with landing ailments and run a Dodge Tank build relatively well, especially if you have access to Epitome of Madness.","Passionate Allure's Auto-Charm can be punished by Daisoujou on the opposing team. This point is moot if you have Panel 2 Atropos, which makes your team immune to Mute.
Requires a good team built around her.
Due to the way the Moirai Sisters archetype is typically built, Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight are a very powerful counter.","As it is classified as a Recovery skill, the AI will spam Woven Fate to heal HP even if there are no downed demons, wasting the charges.
Highly reliant on having Panels to do well, as she faces stiff competition from other Lady / Femme demons like Xi Wangmu and Asherah for the slot in Moirai Sister teams."
"Cu Chulainn",P,P,3,2,2,4,4,"One of the best demons to fuse early on. He has access to Force Pierce, passable MAG stats and can be easily fused through 4x4 fusions.
No weaknesses is a lifesaver early on and gives him more flexibility in transfer skills.
While not common, he can be run as a physical demon to some degree. He has innate Savage Glee and Gae Bolg hits hard against bosses (especially after Panel 1), making him an acceptable option for Phys Democalypse.","High MP costs, cannot Mazandyne Turn 1 in PVP unless Panel 3.
As nothing in his kit boosts Force damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
No Single-Target attack means he will have trouble against Anti-Force-Pierce like Rama + Susano-o A.","He is mostly an early-game demon, and will fall off once you gain access to stronger Pierce sweepers like Baal and Anat.
Low AGI makes him useable in Intimidating Stance teams."
"Cu Chulainn A",T,TP,4,4,4,5,3,"Has full pierce on two elements.
Barbed Spear deals three separate hits, allowing it to function as an Endure breaker.
Culann's Hound provides him an Auto-Charge at end of turn. This allows him to deal massive damage the next turn if he is not dealt with.
Teal has Drain Phys to pair with Rama in Drain Teams, increasing his survivability.","Needs to survive an entire round to make use of Auto-Charge.
Missing just one of Barbed Spear's 12 hits results in lost press turns.
As nothing in his kit boosts Force damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.","Auto-Charge does not activate when waves are cleared in PVE.
Barbed Spear has a hidden accuracy bonus. Combined with innate Epitome of Aggression this gives him more accuracy than one would initially expect."
"Cybele",C,C,3,1,1,5,5,"High MAG stat, Magna Mater, Merciless Blow and innate Trisagion + Maragidyne make her an extremely good Fire caster.
Magna Mater provides a team-wide Fire damage boost, incredible for Democalypse.","Lack of Fire Pierce means she will struggle against Fire NDR.
Expensive multi-fusion that requires clear Asherah.","In PVP, Fire Pierce (weak) is insufficient due to the popularity of Asherah and Rama.
Difficult to Panel due to Clear demons only giving 60 spirits."
"Daisoujou",Any,P,4,5,5,1,1,"Preach makes him immune to all ailments and will punish enemy teams attempting to use Charm. Cleansing Shout is an Ailment and Debuff Cleanse packed into one skill. These two skills function together to make him the best Cleric in the game.
Good balanced stats coupled with no weaknesses and a perfect base kit allows total freedom in builds.
Can work as a bulky tank, evasion tank, healer and/or revive support based on build.
Very useful for Brands of Sin Sloth 11 auto-runs.","Is a hard support unit, relies on transfer skills to offer anything outside cleanse.","He is very good in the current Curse-focused Meta, particularly against Nebiros."
"Dante☆",Any,RP,3,2,2,4,2,"Rapid Shot deals five hits and puts him in a state of Rebellion without consuming any MP. This can be useful versus MP Denial teams like Alice A.
High STR and VIT make him a bulky Phys Sweeper with with no weaknesses, perfect for slower Intimidating Stance Teams.
Million Stab is a piercing multihit AOE skill, useful for breaking Endures. At max levels it also refunds 2 MP on cast, making it easier to spam in PvE.","Low AGI and LUK affects his accuracy.
Missing just one of Rapid Shot's 5 hits results in lost press turns. The Rebellion Autocast will also not trigger if any shot misses.
Million Stab has high MP costs, making it difficult to use for PvP.
No natural Pierce outside Panel 1 might cause issues when out of MP (Rapid Shot does not naturally Pierce).
His Awakening Skills are mostly useless.","Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Demonee-Ho",Y,YP,2,2,2,1,1,"Desperate Hit deals damage to random enemies at the end of his turn. This is great for cleaning up lone surviving targets and/or breaking Endures.
Desperate Hit deals Almighty (Phys) damage, which cannot be negated whatsoever.
Iron Judgement deals Piercing Physical damage with a high chance to Bind, helping him land Desperate Hit shots. Low MP cost also makes it possible to be cast twice per turn even with War Brands.","Combination of ST, AOE, Phys and Almighty elements in his kit makes it difficult to further boost his damage.
Fairly mediocre stats
Iron Judgement has unimpressive Base Power.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.","If you went first, Desperate Hit will trigger before opposing end of turn chain effects (like those from Nebiros and/or Hecate), giving you one last chance to clean up before they kick in.
If Charge or Rebellion is activated before the end of the turn, the effect will carry over to Desperate Hit. It will consume the buff after the attack though!"
"Fafnir",T,T,1,1,1,1,1,"Golden Greed greatly increases poison damage, giving him a unique niche against Celestial Gui Xian.
Red Fafnir meme pull.","Does not have any other niches outside Celestial Gui Xian.
Weak to Ice and Elec.
Red Fafnir meme pull.","Comprehensively outclassed by Pale Rider as a Venomancer.
Red Fafnir meme pull"
"Frost Ace",P,P,3,3,3,2,5,"Very good Ice Nuker with built-in Ice Boost and Master Assassin in purple.
Vengeful Frost Fist is a heavy hitting Ice-element Physical attack that can Crit and autocasts Rebellion on hit. This allows him to crit infinitely at the cost of a measly 4 MP.
Icy Rage provides a teamwide Ice damage buff, incredible for Democalypse.","No added accuracy in his kit. Requires Accuracy investment as Vengeful Frost Fist is prone to missing.
Vengeful Frost Fist cannot hit through Tetrakarn nor any Ice NDR without P3 or Ice Pierce (weak).","-"
"Gabriel",RP,P,4,4,4,5,5,"One of the core demons in the Archangels archetype. When combined with two other Herald or Divine demons, God's Word dishes out massive damage even before battle really begins.
Chain effects do not consume press turns even when hitting NDR.
Innate Thunderclap and Elec Enhancement in Purple means she can function well as an Elec Mage too, particularly for Democalypse.","Needs a specific team built fully around her.
Chain effects kills demons before they have a chance to talk, making her less useful for Aura Gate.
Weak to Dark","The 10% weakness damage bonus from Elec Enhancement applies even to non-Elec skills like God's Word. This allows her to further punish any Hecate, Nebiros and/or Alice A who leave Light Weakness open.
Requires additional MP Support when going against Alice A teams
Reflected God's Word will damage her because of innate pierce. Beware of Alilat and Atavaka."
"Garuda",Any,RP,4,3,3,3,1,"One of the fastest and most flexible demons in the game. With Speedster transferred, he can help your team hit various PVE battle speed requirements, while fulfilling either a support or additional DPS role depending on build.
Vahana provides additional Evasion and can stack with other evasion passives like Evade to make him a dodge tank.
Auto-Rakunda increases your team's damage output and synergizes well with his Turn 1 focus.","Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slots.
Very low bulk
Weak to Ice.","More or less outclassed by Hresvelgr in PVP nowadays.
Red gives him access to discounted Maragidyne, giving him a cheap T1 nuke. Yellow makes him more support-oriented with Fog Breath."
"Garuda A",YP,RP,3,3,3,3,5,"Brilliant Wings fires a Piercing AOE Force attack every time any of your demon successfully dodges an attack. This makes him a powerful pick versus pure physical demons like Masakado and Guan Yu.
Brilliant Wings fits well with evasive demons such as Nekomata A.
Gale Talon is very damaging against lone targets like Bosses, making him very potent for Democalypse. It can also be used for PVP cleanup and/or Endure breaking.","Weak to Ice
Evasion is useless against Magic teams
Gale Talon takes time to reach full potential, reducing his T1 potential.
Needs a team built around him to be really effective","Brilliant Wings will trigger off chain attacks such as Susano-o A's Heavenly Valor. You can use this to your advantage by repeatedly passing against him for free chip damage."
"Gogmagog",T,T,4,3,3,4,3,"Very high bulk, which he can capitalize on thanks to innate Earthquake.
Three weaknesses makes him a good partner for Orcus.
Less competition for Brands compared to your other demons, as he relies on PDEF for damage.
Panels let him play a more support-oriented role, providing team-wide bonuses as long as he is alive.
Repel Phys in Teal pairs well with Alilat or Atavaka for Phys Anti-Pierce.","Abysmal AGI means he misses. A lot.
No innate pierce.","Single target nukes will still hurt him a lot, especially with bonus damage from exploiting his multiple weaknesses."
"Guan Yu",TR,TP,4,5,5,3,4,"No weaknesses and high VIT stats make him very tanky, especially with Life Brands.
High STR and native Phys Pierce make him a physical powerhouse.
Loyal God of War refunds MP and heals him on a kill, giving him insane amounts of self-sustain.
Innate Savage Glee lets him Crit and generate Press Turns effectively, especially if given Epitome of Carnage or paired with Crit boosters like Asura Lord or Kartikeya.
Purple gives him access to Null Mortal, making him even harder to kill.","Low Agi stat means he will have accuracy issues. Dragon Blade's chain effect will not activate if it misses on the first target.
Only has ST skills unless in Red, which reduces his overall PvP usefulness","A Null Curse transfer makes him unkillable by Alice A, and also stops Curse from interfering with Loyal God of War healing.
Highly dependant on the first kill for tempo. Failing to secure the first kill will result in him not having enough MP for the next turn."
"Guts",P,P,4,5,5,5,2,"Extremely high Crit rate thanks to Savage Glee and The Struggler. Butcher in purple further augments his damage.
Dragon Slayer does insane AOE Piercing Physical damage and bypasses Endure-type skills. It can also be cast Turn 1 due to its low MP cost.
Is decently tanky thanks to good bulk and The Struggler providing him a better Enduring Soul.
Panel 1 gives him access to a Piercing Fire AOE that does not cost MP, very useful against MP denial teams.","Having no innate ST skills means he will be walled by Drain Teams. It is recommended to pair him with demons like Alice to eliminate Phys Anti-Pierce demons that prevent him from sweeping.
No natural Pierce outside Panel 2 might cause issues when out of MP.","Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Hecate",P,P,4,5,4,2,5,"Hell's Trivia is a cheap, hard-hitting spell that also functions as an Endure breaker. Coupled with her respectable Mag stat and Dark Enhancement in purple, she can be built as a powerful dark mage.
Virtually immune to ailments thanks to Null Bind and Lunar Awakening. Transferring a cleanse skill like Prayer or Silent Prayer will allow her to function as a cleric, while still maintaining her offensive presence.
Panel 2 lets her run Life or Spell brands without worrying about MP.","Not very bulky due to middling VIT and HP stats.
Weak to light and by extension the Archangels matchup.
As Lunar Awakening only cleanses at the end of the enemy's turn, she can still be killed by Alice A if she is cursed in the same turn (such as through Mahaju).","Innate Repel Dark means she can't be sniped by Alice if paired with Alilat or Atavaka. This is very significant as most dedicated ailment teams run Alice to remove the cleric.
Lunar Awakening only triggers at the end of the enemy's turn. This makes her useless for Brands of Sin Sloth 11, as the ailments trigger at the beginning of the turn."
"Hresvelgr",RP,YP,4,4,4,5,3,"Highest Base AGI in the game, making him invaluable for fast teams.
His unique North Wind deals AOE Ice damage whenever an opposing demon dies. This adds to the damage of fast Turn 1 teams and allows him to clear Endures.
Auto-Rakunda in Purple further increases Turn 1 kill potential.
Decent MAG with innate Ice Boost lets him fire off strong Bufudynes.","No ice pierce.
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slots.
Weak to Phys and Fire. Phys Weakness is particularly bad unless paired with Orcus for Press Turn denial.","-"
"Huang Di",R,RP,4,2,3,5,3,"Superior Power gives him Phys Pierce and an accuracy boost.
Yinglong Killer hits incredibly hard and has a high crit rate, demolishing teams without anti-Pierce.","As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
Yinglong Killer has a very high MP cost and cannot be fired off Turn 1.
Below average HP and Vit stats.","More of less outclassed by Guts. Oh how the mighty have fallen!
AI is very unreliable for PvP Defense; will occasionally Yinglong Killer into Anti-Pierce and lose press turns.
Panel 3 healing has some fun applications together with Lakshmi A, allowing him to restore both HP and MP to the whole party upon a crit."
"Huang Long",YP,YP,4,2,2,1,1,"High AGI, incredible resistances and decent bulk make him a coveted PVE support demon.
Five Elements walls magical demons without Pierce, such as Mother Harlot, Trumpeter and non-purple Rama.
Luster Candy in Yellow gives him even more support utility in buff control. Purple provides him Speedster, giving him full flexibility over which skills to transfer.
Trivializes Brands of Sin stage 10, opening up brand farming on Auto.","Pierce bypasses Five Elements.
Five Elements can be removed through Makara Break, most notably by P3 Samael.

"Indrajit",P,P,3,4,3,3,5,"Lightning Shower provides incredible burst damage due to its high Base Power combined with Indrajit's high base MAG and innate Master Assassin. It can also be looped indefinitely thanks to its low MP cost and Lord of Clouds refunding 3 MP on kill.

Innate Merciless Blow combined with high damage output makes him very valuable for Democalypse.","Weak to Ice.
Low bulk means he will get killed easily if outsped.","Highly dependant on the first kill for tempo. Failing to kill will result in MP Problems.

Most important targets in PvE are immune to Mortal (Bosses, Kiwami Adds etc.)","There is no way to reset her level once you have leveled her up.
You can leave her at Lv 1 to bait the AI into killing her and triggering Yaxche. Pair her with teammates that carry resurrection spells to repeat this cycle like Nebiros and Xi Wangmu.

Measured Fate removes all debuffs from your team and buffs from the enemy team. This ensures the following Passionate Embrace will fully swing buffs in your favor.
Intimidating Stance in Purple synergizes well with the rest of the Moirai Sisters who have very low AGI.
Her Panels provide valuable ailment immunity, making it harder for Ailment Teams to sweep her on revenge.","Requires a good team built around her.
Due to the way the Moirai Sisters archetype is typically built, Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight are a very powerful counter.","The AI will not cast Measured Fate if there are no buffs on your opponent and/or debuffs on you.

Ce Acatl grants him a free revive once per battle, while refunding the press turn lost from his death. This makes him a great counter for Fast T1 Teams on offense, as anything short of a full team wipe will result in him coming back to life and reverse-sweeping with double Aztec Pulses.

Repel Phys in Teal makes him a good partner for Alilat and Atavaka.","Difficult to boost Sword of Actuation further due to it being Almighty Phys.
Requires a good team setup around him to truly shine.
Middling AGI makes him slightly awkward to fit in fast or slow teams.","Has AI issues when used on defense - AI will occasionally target demons with high HP instead of trying to finish off demons with Sword of Actuation.

High MAG and Butcher in purple allows him to function as a strong almighty sweeper. In addition to dealing respectable almighty damage, Path of Prominence also applies a mini Luster Candy buff, extending his role as a buff control specialist.
Yellow gives him access to discounted Mediarahan, allowing him to function as a decent PVE Healer.","Very hard to further boost his damage.

No innate AoE.
Much better Force users exist for PvP.","-"
"Man Eater",TP,P,2,2,2,0,0,"Her unique passive Sass lowers the defense of the team for 3 turns when the enemy is charmed. Useful in wave based battle due to Auto-Rakunda only working on the first wave nor having to waste a turn casting a defense debuff.

Good AGI/LU stat
Panel 2 and 3 serve him greatly such as granting EV% and Ailment Infliction%.","Average MAG stat making Mediarama and Mazionga fairly weak for his kit.
Expensive Fusion due to requiring a valuable resource of one of each mitama.
